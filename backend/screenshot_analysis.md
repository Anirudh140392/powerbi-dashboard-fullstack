## Analysis

The screenshots show COMPLETELY DIFFERENT metrics. This suggests:
1. The user may have an old build or cached version
2. There might be multiple metrics dropdowns on different pages
3. The user might be looking at a different dropdown than the one in "Skus Overview"

Let me search for where these hardcoded metrics might be defined.
